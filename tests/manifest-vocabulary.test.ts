/**
 * The pm CLI reads only the keys of its closed extension-manifest vocabulary
 * (`name`, `version`, `entry`, `priority`, `description`, `author`,
 * `capabilities`, `manifest_version`, `pm_min_version`, `pm_max_version`,
 * `engines`, `trusted`, `provenance`, `sandbox_profile`, `permissions`,
 * `activation`, `contributions`, `legacy_capability_aliases`) and ignores every
 * other key. Since CLI 2026.8.19 an out-of-vocabulary key also surfaces as a
 * `manifest_unknown_key` warning finding — which is exactly what made this
 * package's former inert `pm: {"compatibility": "v2"}` blob and its embedded
 * preset catalog visible in `pm health` output and in strict CI assertions
 * downstream (see unbraind/pm-linear PRs #75/#76, whose smoke suite asserts
 * exact finding codes). The catalog now lives in `presets.json`.
 *
 * This check runs the SDK's own manifest gate against the bytes on disk, so any
 * key the running CLI does not recognize fails here instead of shipping as a
 * silent warning.
